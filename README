Building
========

	Windows
	=======
	
	To build pymssql on Windows you firstly must have:

		* Visual C++ >= 2005 (or some equivalent compiler)
		* Python >= 2.5
		* Cython >= 0.12
	
	and then you can simple run:
		
		python setup.py build
	
	which will build pymssql in the normal python fashion.

	Unix
	====

	To build on Unix you must have:
	
		* gcc
		* python-dev >= 2.5
		* Cython >= 0.12
		* FreeTDS >= 0.82
	
Testing
=======

To run the tests simply go to the "tests" folder and execute:

	python all.py

Which will go through and run all the tests with the default server
settings. If you wish to change these settings you can create a 'tests.cfg'
file in the tests folder that gets read for server settings. This file
should have the format:

[DEFAULT]
server = hostname
username = username
password = password
database = database

[SomeServer]
server = someserver
username = someuser
password = somepass
database = somedb

When this file exists you can run any test specifying a server as the first argument to the command such as:

	python all.py SomeServer
